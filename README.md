# Utrecht University - Noldus Information Technologies Thesis:

Conducted my research thesis under the supervision of Dr. Stella Donker and Dr. Tess den Uyl titled “Reading Emotions: Automatic Recognition of Engagement Using Facial Expressions and Physiological Measures”. In the research, I collected multi-modal data using different tools such as Facial Action Units with FaceReader, Skin Conductance and Photoplethysmography with Biopac, Eye Tracking with Tobii, and participants' responses using PsychoPy.

You can find the Python code I used for cleaning, processing, visualizing data, and applying machine learning algorithms.
